# margin-border-padding-content
The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between 
our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.

The border is the edge of the element. It's what we've been making visible every time we set the border property.

The padding is the spacing between the content and the border. We can adjust this value with CSS to move the 
border closer to or farther from the content.

The content is the actual "stuff" in the box. If we're talking about a <p> element, the "stuff" is the text of the paragraph.

You'll see abbreviations like TM, TB, and TP in the diagram. These stand for "top margin," "top border," and "top padding.
" As we'll see, we can adjust the top, right, left, and bottom padding, border, and margin individually.
